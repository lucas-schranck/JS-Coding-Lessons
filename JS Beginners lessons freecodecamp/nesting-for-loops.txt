/* You will use double "for"
this is because there are two arrays, one inside the other
each for assesses each 
multiplyAll will need double checks: 
one for outer array (A)
one for inner array (B) 
arr[A][B] will make use of both of them
This is why product * arr[A][B] also multiplies the third number
arr.length is used to utilize all the length of said array*/
