JavaScript Learning Path
A curated collection of my JavaScript projects and exercises, completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. This repository serves as a personal archive and a demonstration of my journey from fundamental concepts to moderately complex programming challenges.

üìö Overview
This repository documents my progression through FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript lessons. Each project and code snippet represents a key concept mastered, from basic syntax and control flow to more advanced topics like functional programming and basic algorithms.

üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
The repository is organized by concept and difficulty:

Fundamentals: Variables, Data Types, Operators, Functions, Conditional Statements (if/else, switch), Loops (for, while).

Data Structures: Arrays and Objects manipulation, including methods like map, filter, reduce, and forEach.

Algorithm Scripting: Basic to intermediate algorithmic challenges focusing on problem-solving and logic.

Functional Programming: Concepts like immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions.

Intermediate Concepts: Closures, Recursion, and basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Language: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Environment: Node.js, Browser Console

üéØ Purpose
For Me: To track my learning progress and have a reference for key JavaScript concepts.

For Viewers: To see practical examples of JavaScript concepts and the problem-solving process from a learner's perspective.
