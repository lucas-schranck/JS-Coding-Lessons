A curated collection of my JavaScript projects and exercises, completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. This repository serves as a personal archive and a demonstration of my journey from fundamental concepts to moderately complex programming challenges.

üìö Overview
This repository documents my progression through FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript lessons. Each project and code snippet represents a key concept mastered, from basic syntax and control flow to more advanced topics like functional programming and basic algorithms.

üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure
The code is organized by core concepts and increasing difficulty:

Directory	Concepts Covered
JS Beginners lessons freecodecamp/	Very simple concepts, Variables, Data Types, Operators, up to OOP Basics
JS ES6 coding/ The first steps in JS ES6
